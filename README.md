## Overview of the Project
This projected attempted to use data obtained from Instagram extract information by using algorithmic and statistical techniques. Furthermore it attempted to give a better understanding of numerical by visualizing the data by using various plotting techniques.

## Summary of the files
1. __`main.ipynb`__: 
	> This notebook contains the all the answers the assignment. Most of the code cells are composed of functions being called from the `functions.py` file with some small additions. The code cells gives verbal answers to questions and plots the required figures. It starts by answering the Research Questions, follows by the Bonus Points, and ends with Algorithmic Questions.

2. __`functions.py`__: 
	> It is a collection of all the functions that are used to do the calculations.

3. __`CommandLine.sh`__: 
	> The script that answers the command line question
